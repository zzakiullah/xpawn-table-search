# XPawn Assignment: Dynamic Multi-Table Search

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design Choices & Thought Process

- Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Shadcn UI
- 

## Additional Features

## (Hypothetical) Next Steps

- Wanted an option for the user to upload their own files (I actually had most of it ready but ran out of time, so I left it commented out)
- Ideally the multi-table views should also stack horizontally too; at the moment they only stack vertically since it was faster to program that way
